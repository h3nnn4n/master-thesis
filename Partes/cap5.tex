\chapter{Final Considerations and Future Work}
\label{chap:final_considerations}

% Intro to the final considerations
Proteins are macromolecules found in all known living forms and are
considered to be the working horses of the cells. The biological
function of any given protein is directly dependent on its
function, in a way that knowing it is a very valuable information
for several fields of science. The Human
Genome~\footnote{\url{https://www.genome.gov/10001772/all-about-the--human-genome-project-hgp/}}
and Human Proteome~\footnote{\url{https://hupo.org/human-proteome-project}} project
lead to a exponentially increasing number of sequenced proteins.
However, due to the price and time efforts required to structure
these proteins, a gap quickly formed between the number of sequenced
and structured proteins. This gap now spans more than 3 orders
of magnitude. With that in mind, computer scientists, mathematicians,
physicists, chemists and biologists have been working to accurately
predict the structure of a protein from its primary
sequence and it is known as \textit{ab initio} PSPP.

\section{Future Works}\label{sec:future_works}

% Secondary Structure Prediction
While the proposed methods were able to outperform the methods from the
literature some flaws and weak points were identified. Possibly the major
source of errors in the proposed methods was the heavy dependence on the
information from the Secondary Structure Predictor. A future research direction
would be to employ more than one predictor, in a way that if one is wrong,
there is a chance that the other is not. It is also possible to research in the
direction of making the Tertiary Structure Prediction either less dependent on
the Secondary Structure Prediction or making it more resilient to faulty
information.

% Operators that are more smart (apl or something like that)
Another weak point of the proposed methods is the destructive interference
between the DE operators and the fragment insertion operators. Therefore, a
possible future research direction is to investigate how this interference
happens and how it can be avoided.  One possibility is to give information to
the DE operators about the problem domain, so that they do not operate blindly,
similar to the approach of~\cite{borguesan2015apl}.

% Better frags
The use of better generated fragments is also a research direction, since a big
portion of the conformation sampling method is dependent on it. A fragment
library of poor quality will lead to a poor prediction.
% More hybridization
The further hybridization with methods can also be considered.  One possible
direction is the inclusion on gradient descent methods to quickly find nearby
areas of low energy.
% Diversity
Another weak point of this work is that there is no passive or active method of
controlling the diversity of the population. This, as show in other
works~\cite{narloch2016diversification,simoncini2017balancing}, can lead to
better predictions.

% Better conformation sampling
A recent trend worth exploring is the focusing the search on loops and coil
regions of the proteins. These areas usually have a lower acceptance rate of
perturbation due to the high impact they have on the overall conformation.  In
contrast, $\alpha$-helices are relatively stable and have a much higher
acceptance rate while having a low impact in the overall structure.
Furthermore, the use of forced moves has also seem some recent use. With this,
it is possible to escape local minima by accepting conformation changes that
decrease the energy score.

% Expand the protein set
The expansion of the protein set is a clear future direction for this work as
it would help to validate and investigate better the proposed methods. However,
due to a lack of a standard protein set in the literature the comparison to
other works is not always direct.
% Provide an extra partial comparison to other works
A future step is to compare partially to other works, this would allow for a
bigger number of methods to be compared against.
% Use more function evaluations
The use of more function evaluations is also a point of this work which can be
improved. The current setup used 500 thousand function evaluations to match
other works in the literature. However, in a real world scenario, a prediction
that takes days would still be faster than the current \textit{in vitro}
methods. It could possibly allow for the proposed hybrid method to behave
differently in the later stages of the prediction.
% Include more metrics (tm score etc)
Finally, as RMSD has several disadvantages, the use of other metrics seems a
clear future research direction. Metrics such as the TM-Score and GDT-TS offers
normalized scores that can be used to measure the performance of different
methods on different proteins directly.  However, the use of these metrics are
still not wide spread and have very few works using it. This limits the current
potential of using these metrics to compare to other works. %Nevertheless,
there is the possibility of laying a foundation of using better metrics in the
future.

\subsection{Chronogram}

For the first half of February an initial analysis of convergence will be
realized with the goal of assessing the more likely bottlenecks of the methods.
Both the genotipic and phenotipic diversity will be studied. Then for the rest
of the month and for March the study of using niching methods will be explored.
Initially a literature review will be ran to extract the main methods of
niching for DE.  Based on that, a preliminary exploration phase and the results
of the convergence analysis it will be identified what needs to be done and
implemented. A set of preliminary experiments will be ran in order to identify
the impact of the niching methods.

In the month of April, a study of local operators will be ran, starting with a
literature review to identify the main methods.  A comparative analysis will be
done based on the methods found, its performance and ease of implementation or
source code availability. Then, a integration phase of the considered local
search methods into the current best method from the previous experimentation
will be put into effect.

The month of May will be dedicated for studying how to shape the search process
better into the problem. This stage of the research will be mostly dependent in
identifying the main weak points of the methods and trying to improve it. Also,
the correctness of the method will be revised with the goal of improving code
quality and removing bugs and errors in implementation.

The remaining months will be dedicated for further exploration into previous
experiments, running the current methods with a expanded set of proteins and
possibly for longer and/or with a bigger function evaluation budget. In
parallel, the writing of the thesis will be carried out.
