% Intro to the final considerations
Proteins are macromolecules found in all known living forms and are
considered to be the working horses of the cells. The biological
function of any given protein is directly dependent on its
function, in a way that knowing it is a very valuable information
for several fields of science. The Human
Genome~\footnote{\url{https://www.genome.gov/10001772/all-about-the--human-genome-project-hgp/}}
and Human Proteome~\footnote{\url{https://hupo.org/human-proteome-project}} project
lead to a exponentially increasing number of sequenced proteins.
However, due to the price and time efforts required to structure
these proteins, a gap quickly formed between the number of sequenced
and structured proteins. This gap now spans more than 3 orders
of magnitude. With that in mind, computer scientists, mathematicians,
physicists, chemists and biologists have been working to accurately
predict the structure of a protein from its primary
sequence and it is known as \textit{ab initio} PSPP.

In light of this, this work proposed two method, sade-mc-final and
sade-remc-final, to attempt to solve the problem. The proteins were evaluated
using \texttt{score0}, \texttt{score3} and \texttt{scorefxn} energy functions
from Rosetta. The protein was modeled using a full atomic model of the backbone,
manipulated using fragments and torsions angles, as well as side chain centroids.
In later stages of the prediction the model was switch to a full atomic
representation of the protein. The proposed method is capable of outputting
several conformations that are different from each other, this is accomplished
by using a clustering process. This, in turn, allows for a human expert to
evaluate and choose the best conformation based on its knowledge and intuition.

The proposed method were compared against a method from a previous work as
well as two variants. In a first stage, the two proposed methods were compared
against the other methods using both the RMSD and potential energy. For both
metrics a rigorous set of statistical tests was applied, which identified that
the proposed methods consistently outperform the competitors both with lower
RMSD and lower potential energies. In a second stage, rosetta, one of the
winners and top competitors at CASP was chosen to be compared against, as a
representative of state-of-the-art. The same statistical framework was applied.
The results indicates that the proposed method is able to give equal or better
predictions than rosetta in most cases.

A second analysis of prediction error was realized using GDT-TS and TM-Score,
which provided further insights, complementary to RMSD. Firstly, it was observed
that GDT-TS appears to be more strict about the results than RMSD. Furthermore,
TM-Score appears to be even stricter. Another key-point observed, is that the
three metrics does not always agree, where they gave values significantly
apart. Nevertheless, studying the GDT-TS and TM-Score gave the insights that
the prediction could be improved even further for several of the proteins which
judging just by RMSD alone were considered near native conformations. In the end,
the raw data from these observations was made available in order to allow for
future works to compare against ours using rigorous statistical methods.

A visual analysis was utilized to try and identify what the main prediction
errors were. Four proteins were detected as having major errors. From these,
three had its errors tracked down to the predicted secondary structure, which is
and input of the proposed methods. As such, the predictions were made using
incorrect data, leading to a sub par performance.

\section{Future Works}\label{sec:future_works}

% Secondary Structure Prediction
While the proposed methods were able to outperform the methods from the
literature some flaws and weak points were identified. Possibly the major
source of errors in the proposed methods was the heavy dependence on the
information from the Secondary Structure Predictor. A future research direction
would be to employ more than one predictor, in a way that if one is wrong,
there is a chance that the other is not. It is also possible to research in the
direction of making the Tertiary Structure Prediction either less dependent on
the Secondary Structure Prediction or making it more resilient to faulty
information.

% Better frags
The use of better generated fragments is also a research direction, since a big
portion of the conformation sampling method is dependent on it. A fragment
library of poor quality will lead to a poor prediction.
% More hybridization
The further hybridization with methods can also be considered.  One possible
direction is the inclusion on gradient descent methods to quickly find nearby
areas of low energy.
% Diversity
Another weak point of this work is that there is no passive or active method of
controlling the diversity of the population. This, as show in other
works~\cite{narloch2016diversification,simoncini2017balancing}, can lead to
better predictions.

% Better conformation sampling
A recent trend worth exploring is the focusing the search on loops and coil
regions of the proteins. These areas usually have a lower acceptance rate of
perturbation due to the high impact they have on the overall conformation.  In
contrast, $\alpha$-helices are relatively stable and have a much higher
acceptance rate while having a low impact in the overall structure.

% Add restarts
Running a method for too long will most likely given diminishing returns, as
the diversity decreases. One way to give better predictions is to periodically
reset parts of the population or the full population if stagnation occurs. This
can allow for the method to run longer and possibly lead to better predictions.
In particular, partial population re-initialization allows for old information
to contribute to the newer generated individuals.

% LS for SaDE
The proposed methods applied Hooke-Jeeves pattern search as one of the last steps.
However, on direction would be to use Hooke-Jeeves, or other local search
procedure as an operator for SaDE. This would allow for the method to quickly
find local regions of good potential energy. However, this could also lead to
premature convergence, and as such, it must have a counter acting way of
preventing the population from getting stuck. Further, due to the nature of
SaDE, it is possible that the local search operators perform too well at the
start, making SaDE heavily prefer it. Then, at latter stages, they will
have diminishing returns. However, SaDE will keep heavily applying the
same operators over and over again. Therefore, it might be required for another
strategy to be utilized to control which operator is applied.
